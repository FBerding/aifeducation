Description: In social and educational settings, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
  a challenging task. Relevant data
  is often only available in handwritten forms or the use of data is restricted
  by privacy policies, often leading to small data sets. Futhermore, data in the
  educational and social sciences is often unbalanced in terms of frequencies.
  To support educators as well as eductional and social reserachers in using the potentials of
  AI for their work, this package provides a unified interface for neural nets in keras
  and tensorflow to deal with natural language problems. The tools integrate existing 
  mathematical and statitical methods for dealing with
  small data sets via pseudo-labeling and imbalanced data via the creation of synthetic
  cases. Performance evaluation of AI is connected to measures from content analysis
  which educational and social researchers are generally more familiar with. Finally,
  all objects created with this package allow to share trained AI with other people.
