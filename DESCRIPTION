Description: In social and educational settings using Artificial Intelligence is
  a challenging tasks. Relevant data
  is often available only in hand written forms or the use of data is restricted
  by privacy policies leading to only small datasets. Futhermore, data in
  educational and social science is often unbalanced in terms of their frequencies.
  To support educators, eductional and social reserachers in using the potentials of
  AI for their work this package provides a unified interface to neural nets in keras
  and tensorflow in dealing with natural language problems. Tools integrate existing 
  mathematical and statitical methods for dealing with
  small data sets via pseudo labeling and imbalanced data via the creation of synthetic
  cases. Performance evaluation of AI is connected to measures from content analysis
  which educational and social researchers are generally more familiar with. Finally,
  all objects created with this package allow to share trained AI with other persons.
