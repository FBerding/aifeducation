\arguments{
\item{output_dir}{\code{string} Path to the directory where the final model
should be saved. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.}

\item{bert_model_dir_path}{\code{string} Path to the directory where the original
model is stored.}

\item{raw_texts}{\code{vector} containing the raw texts for training.}

\item{aug_vocab_by}{\code{int} Number of entries for extending the current
vocabulary. See notes for more details}

\item{p_mask}{\code{double} Ratio determining the number of words/tokens for masking.}

\item{whole_word}{\code{bool} \code{TRUE} if whole word masking should be applied.
If \code{FALSE} token masking is used.}

\item{val_size}{\code{double} Ratio determining the amount of token chunks used for
validation.}

\item{n_epoch}{\code{int} Number of epochs for training.}

\item{batch_size}{\code{int} Size of batches.}

\item{chunk_size}{\code{int} Size of every chunk for training.}

\item{learning_rate}{\code{double} Learning rate for adam optimizer.}

\item{n_workers}{\code{int} Number of workers.}

\item{multi_process}{\code{bool} \code{TRUE} if multiple processes should be activated.}

\item{trace}{\code{bool} \code{TRUE} if information on the progress should be printed
to the console.}
}
\value{
This function does not return an object. Instead the trained or fine-tuned
model is saved to disk.
}
\description{
This function can be used to train or fine-tune a transformer
based on BERT architecture with the help of the python libraries 'transformers',
'datasets', and 'tokenizers'.
}
\note{
if \code{aug_vocab_by > 0} the raw text is used for training a WordPiece
tokenizer. At the end of this process, additional entries are added to the vocabulary
that are not part of the original vocabulary. This is in an experimental state.

Pre-Trained models which can be fine-tuned with this function are available
at \url{https://huggingface.co/}.

New models can be created via the function \link{create_bert_model}.

Training of the model makes use of dynamic masking in contrast to the
original paper where static masking was applied.
