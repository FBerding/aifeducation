\usage{
create_synthetic_units(
  embedding,
  target,
  k,
  max_k,
  method,
  cat,
  cat_freq,
  inc_major
)
}
\arguments{
\item{embedding}{Named \code{data.frame} containing the text embeddings.
In most cases this object is taken from \link[=EmbeddedText]{EmbeddedText$embeddings}.}

\item{target}{Named \code{factor} containing the labels/categories of the corresponding cases.}

\item{k}{\code{int} The number of nearest neighbors during sampling process.}

\item{max_k}{\code{int} The maximum number of nearest neighbors during sampling process.}

\item{method}{\code{vector} containing strings of the requested methods for generating new cases.
Currently "smote","dbsmote", and "adas" from package smotefamily are available.}

\item{cat}{\code{string} The category for which new cases should be created.}

\item{cat_freq}{Object of class \code{"table"} containing the absolute frequencies
of every category/label.}

\item{inc_major\code{bool}}{If \code{TRUE} the major category is considered for creating
new synthetic units.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{list} which contains the text embeddings of the
new synthetic cases as a named \code{data.frame} and their labels as a named
\code{factor}.
}
\description{
Function for creating synthetic cases in order to balance the data for
training with \link{TextEmbeddingClassifierNeuralNet}. This is a helper
function for use with \link{get_synthetic_cases} to allow parallel
computations.
