<h2 class="pkg-version" data-toc-text="1.0.0" id="aifeducation-100">aifeducation 1.0.0<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#aifeducation-100"></a></h2><p class="text-muted">CRAN release: 2024-12-20</p>
<p>First complete release of the package including major changes, bug fixes, new features, and objects.</p>
<p>The most important change is that we decided to use ‘PyTorch’ for several reasons. First, ‘PyTorch’ is a very flexible and stable machine learning framework. At the moment, most new architectures are based on ‘PyTorch’ as can be seen on Hugging Face. Currently (11th November 2024) there are 190,237 models for this framework compared to 13,346 models for ‘tensorflow’. Second, ‘PyTorch’ provides an easy installation and supports native GPU acceleration on Linux and Windows while tensorflow supports native GPU support only on Linux and for Windows only in version 2.10 or lower. Fourth, keras, which was an important element of ‘tensorflow’, changed to a multi-back-end framework. However, keras 3.0 does not have a native Windows support. Since we assume that many educational researchers use either Windows or Mac and are not familiar with more complex system configurations (such as using Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)), this is problematic.</p>
<p>In addition, we changed the algorithm for saving and loading models, data, and objects to ensure that models trained with the package are working within future versions of <em>aifeducation</em> and can be updated to new developments. This is also necessary to allow reproducibility of models and research based on these models. To achieve this goal we had to make some changes for models created with version 0.3.3 or lower. If you still need these models, please install an older version of <em>aifeducation</em>.</p>
<p>The following changes have been made:</p>
<p><strong>Major Changes</strong></p>
<ul><li>The core machine learning framework is now ‘PyTorch’. ‘Tensorflow’ is still supported but only for some models and limited to version 2.15. Further implementation and support for ‘tensorflow’ models is currently not planned. We decided to base the package on ‘PyTorch’ because this framework is widely used in research, is very flexible, provides a broad GPU support, and offers more stable code across versions.</li>
<li>Implemented a new mechanic and new methods for all objects allowing objects that were created with an older version of the package to update to the current version during loading.</li>
<li>Removed the bag-of-words models from the package in order to focus the package on approaches which use AI.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Installation and Configuration</strong></p>
<ul><li>Added a new function for a convenient installation of ‘python’ and ‘pytorch’.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Transformer Models</strong></p>
<ul><li>Complete rewrite of all transformer functions into a modern object-oriented approach with R6 classes (AIFETransformerMaker).</li>
<li>Functions of type create_xxx_model and train_xxx_model are now deprecated.</li>
<li>Added support for MPNet with ‘pytorch’ and ‘tensorflow’.</li>
</ul><p><strong>TEFeatureExtractor</strong></p>
<ul><li>Adding TEFeatureExtractor as a new class for ‘pytorch’ only.</li>
<li>TEFeatureExtractor are auto-encoders that can be used to reduce the number of features of text embeddings before passing them onto classifiers. Their aim is to reduce computational time and/or increase performance of classifiers.</li>
</ul><p><strong>TextEmbeddingClassifiers</strong></p>
<ul><li>TEClassifierRegular replaces TextEmbeddingClassifierNeuralNet. This new class provides additional methods and fixes a bug for pytorch models used to predict two classes.</li>
<li>TextEmbeddingClassifierNeuralNet is now deprecated.<br></li>
<li>Added TEClassifierProtoNet which is a classifier that applys methods of meta-learning based on ProtoNets.</li>
<li>In comparison to TextEmbeddingClassifierNeuralNet, the training loop for the new classes was altered and reduced in its complexity for users. For example, only the type of pseudo-labeling described by Cascante-Bonilla et al. (2020) is now implemented and at the same type the technique described by Lee (2013) was removed. In addition, it is now possible to add synthetic cases within every step of pseudo-labeling. See the vignettes for more details.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Graphical User Interface Aifeducation Studio</strong></p>
<ul><li>Complete rewrite of the user interface based on bslib while removing the dependencies to shinydashboard.</li>
<li>User interface only supports pytorch and no longer tensorflow.</li>
<li>Implemented long running tasks such as training a transformer as a shiny ExtendedTask. This allows the computation of the task in the background and the shiny app to stay responsive. This, in turn, avoids “greying out” of the app.</li>
<li>Implemented a new reporting system for providing a feedback to the user during computations.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Data Management</strong></p>
<ul><li>Introduced two new classes LargeDataSetForTextEmbeddings and LargeDataSetForText based on the python libraries ‘arrow’ and ‘datasets’ allowing to store and use data that would not fit into memory. LargeDataSetForText stores raw texts while LargeDataSetForTextEmbeddings contain text embeddings.</li>
<li>Added support to all AI models for these new kinds of objects to allow training with large data sets.</li>
<li>Added new methods to objects of class EmbeddedTexts (e.g. for converting EmbeddedTexts into a LargeDataSetForTextEmbeddings). See the corresponding documentation for more details.</li>
<li>The function combine_embeddings is now deprecated. Please use the corresponding method of EmbeddedTexts.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Saving and Loading</strong></p>
<ul><li>Introduced save_to_disk and load_from_disk as the new core functions for saving and loading objects and models of this package.</li>
<li>Functions load_ai_model and save_ai_model are now deprecated. Please use these functions only for models created with version 0.3.3 or lower.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Further Changes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Removed the dependencies to package abind and irr.</li>
<li>Updated vignettes.</li>
