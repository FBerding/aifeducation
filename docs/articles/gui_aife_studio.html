<p>This vignette introduces <em>Aifeducation - Studio</em> which is a
graphical user interface for creating, training, documenting, analyzing,
and applying artificial intelligence (AI). It is made for users
unfamiliar with <em>R</em> or those who do not have coding skills in
relevant languages (e.g., python). For more experienced users, the
interface provides a convenient way for working with AI in an
educational context.</p>
<p>This article overlaps with vignette <a href="classification_tasks.html">03 Using R syntax</a>, which explains
how to use the package with <em>R</em> syntax. We assume that
<em>aifeducation</em> is installed as described in vignette <a href="https://fberding.github.io/aifeducation/articles/aifeducation.html">01
Get Started</a>. The introduction starts with a brief explanation of the
basic concepts, which are necessary to work with this package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="basic-concepts">1.2 Basic Concepts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-concepts"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the educational and social sciences, assigning scientific concepts
to observations is an important task that allows researchers to
understand an observation, to generate new insights, and to derive
recommendations for research and practice.</p>
<p>In educational science, several areas deal with this kind of task.
For example, diagnosing students’ characteristics is an important aspect
of a teachers’ profession and necessary to understand and promote
learning. Another example is the use of learning analytics, where data
about students is used to provide learning environments adapted to their
individual needs. On another level, educational institutions such as
schools and universities can use this information for data-driven
performance decisions (Laurusson &amp; White 2014) as well as where and
how to improve it. In any case, a real-world observation is aligned with
scientific models to use scientific knowledge as a technology for
improved learning and instruction.</p>
<p>Supervised machine learning is one concept that allows a link between
real-world observations and existing scientific models and theories
(Berding et al. 2022). For the educational sciences, this is a great
advantage because it allows researchers to use the existing knowledge
and insights to apply AI. The drawback of this approach is that the
training of AI requires both information about the real world
observations and information on the corresponding alignment with
scientific models and theories.</p>
<p>A valuable source of data in educational science are written texts,
since textual data can be found almost everywhere in the realm of
learning and teaching (Berding et al. 2022). For example, teachers often
require students to solve a task which they provide in a written form.
Students have to create a solution for the tasks which they often
document with a short written essay or a presentation. This data can be
used to analyze learning and teaching. Teachers’ written tasks for their
students may provide insights into the quality of instruction while
students’ solutions may provide insights into their learning outcomes
and prerequisites.</p>
<p>AI can be a helpful assistant in analyzing textual data since the
analysis of textual data is a challenging and time-consuming task for
humans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that an introduction to content analysis, natural
language processing or machine learning is beyond the scope of this
vignette. If you would like to learn more, please refer to the cited
literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we start, it is necessary to introduce a definition of our
understanding of some basic concepts, since applying AI to educational
contexts means to combine the knowledge of different scientific
disciplines using different, sometimes overlapping concepts. Even within
a single research area, concepts are not unified. Figure 1 illustrates
this package’s understanding.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="classif_fig_01.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 1: Understanding of Central Concepts"><div class="figcaption">Figure 1: Understanding of Central
Concepts</div>
</div>
<p>Since <em>aifeducation</em> looks at the application of AI for
classification tasks from the perspective of the empirical method of
content analysis, there is some overlapping between the concepts of
content analysis and machine learning. In content analysis, a phenomenon
like performance or colors can be described as a scale/dimension which
is made up by several categories (e.g. Schreier 2012, pp. 59). In our
example, an exam’s performance (scale/dimension) could be “good”,
“average” or “poor”. In terms of colors (scale/dimension) categories
could be “blue”, “green”, etc. Machine learning literature uses other
words to describe this kind of data. In machine learning, “scale” and
“dimension” correspond to the term “label” while “categories” refer to
the term “classes” (Chollet, Kalinowski &amp; Allaire 2022, p. 114).</p>
<p>With these clarifications, classification means that a text is
assigned to the correct category of a scale or, respectively, that the
text is labeled with the correct class. As Figure 2 illustrates, two
kinds of data are necessary to train an AI to classify text in line with
supervised machine learning principles.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="classif_fig_02.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 2: Basic Structure of Supervised Machine Learning"><div class="figcaption">Figure 2: Basic Structure of Supervised Machine
Learning</div>
</div>
<p>By providing AI with both the textual data as input data and the
corresponding information about the class as target data, AI can learn
which texts imply a specific class or category. In the above exam
example, AI can learn which texts imply a “good”, an “average” or a
“poor” judgment. After training, AI can be applied to new texts and
predict the most likely class of every new text. The generated class can
be used for further statistical analysis or to derive recommendations
about learning and teaching.</p>
<p>In use cases as described in this vignette, AI has to “understand”
natural language: „Natural language processing is an area of research in
computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with
processing natural languages such as English and Mandarin. This
processing generally involves translating natural language into data
(numbers) that a computer can use to learn about the world. (…)” (Lane ,
Howard &amp; Hapke 2019, p. 4)</p>
<p>Thus, the first step is to transform raw texts into a a form that is
usable for a computer, hence raw texts must be transformed into numbers.
In modern approaches, this is usually done through word embeddings.
Campesato (2021, p. 102) describes them as “the collective name for a
set of language modeling and feature learning techniques (…) where words
or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.”
The definition of a word vector is similar: „Word vectors represent the
semantic meaning of words as vectors in the context of the training
corpus.” (Lane, Howard &amp; Hapke 2019, p. 191). In the next step, the
words or text embeddings can be used as input data and the labels as
target data for training AI to classify a text.</p>
<p>In <em>aifeducation,</em> these steps are covered with three
different types of models, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="classif_model_hierachy.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 3: Modells Types in aifeducation"><div class="figcaption">Figure 3: Modells Types in aifeducation</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Base Models:</strong> The base models are the models
which contain the capacities to understand natural language. In general,
these are transformers such as BERT, RoBERTa, etc. A huge number of
pre-trained models can be found on <a href="https://huggingface.co/" class="external-link">Huggingface</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text Embedding Models:</strong> The modes are built on
top of base models and store directions on how to use these base models
for converting raw texts into sequences of numbers. Please note that the
same base model can be used to create different text embedding
models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Classifiers:</strong> Classifiers are used on top of a
text embedding model. They are used to classify a text into
categories/classes based on the numeric representation provided by the
corresponding text embedding model. Please note that a text embedding
model can be used to create different classifiers (e.g. one classifier
for colors, one classifier to estimate the quality of a text,
etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of this overview we can start the introduction of
<em>Aifeducation Studio</em>.</p>

<h5 id="creating-a-dataset">3.1.1.1 Creating a Dataset<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-dataset"></a>
</h5>
<p>The fist step in working with AI is to gather and to structure data.
In the scope of <em>aifeducation,</em> data can be either a collection
of raw texts, sequences of numbers representing the texts (text
embeddings) or texts’ labels.</p>
<p>Collections of raw texts are necessary in two cases: First, to train
or to fine-tune base models. Second, to transform texts into numerical
representations (texts embeddings) which can be used as input for
training a classifier or for predicting texts’ labels via
classifiers.</p>
<p>To create a collection of raw texts, you have to choose the <em>Data
Management</em> page on the top panel as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_Create.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 5: Data Management Page"><div class="figcaption">Figure 5: Data Management Page</div>
</div>
<p>On the resulting page (see Figure 6), you first have to choose the
directory where the texts are stored (box <em>Text Sources</em>). We
recommend that you store all texts you would like to use in a single
folder. Within this folder, you can structure your data with
sub-folders.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_Create_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 6: Data Preparation Page"><div class="figcaption">Figure 6: Data Preparation Page</div>
</div>
<p>In the next step, you can decide which file formats should be
included (box <em>File Types</em>). Currently, <em>aifeducation</em>
supports .txt, .pdf, and .xlsx files. If enabled, all files of the
requested file format are included in your data collection.</p>
<p><strong>.txt files</strong></p>
<p>The first alternative is to store raw texts in .txt files. To use
these you have to structure your data in a specific way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a main folder for storing your data.</li>
<li>Store every raw text/document into a <em>single</em> .txt file into
its <em>own</em> folder within the main folder. In every folder there
should be only one file for a raw text/document.</li>
<li>Add an additional .txt file to the folder named
<code>bib_entry.txt</code>. This file contains bibliographic information
for the raw text.</li>
<li>Add an additional .txt file to the folder named
<code>license.txt</code> which contains a short statement for the
license of the text such as “CC BY”.</li>
<li>Add an additional .txt file to the folder named
<code>url_license.txt</code> which contains the URL/link to the license’
text such as “<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="external-link uri">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a>”.</li>
<li>Add an additional .txt file to the folder named
<code>text_license.txt</code> which contains the full license in raw
texts.</li>
<li>Add an additional .txt file to the folder named
<code>url_source.txt</code> which contains the URL/link to the text file
in the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying these rules may result in a data structure as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folder “main folder”
<ul>
<li>Folder Text A
<ul>
<li>text_a.txt</li>
<li>bib_entry.txt</li>
<li>license.txt</li>
<li>url_license.txt</li>
<li>text_license.txt</li>
<li>url_source.txt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Folder Text B
<ul>
<li>text_b.txt</li>
<li>bib_entry.txt</li>
<li>license.txt</li>
<li>url_license.txt</li>
<li>text_license.txt</li>
<li>url_source.txt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Folder Text C
<ul>
<li>text_c.txt</li>
<li>bib_entry.txt</li>
<li>license.txt</li>
<li>url_license.txt</li>
<li>text_license.txt</li>
<li>url_source.txt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, that adding a <code>bib_entry.txt</code>,
<code>license.txt</code>, <code>url_license.txt</code>,
<code>text_license.txt</code>, and <code>url_source.text</code> to every
folder is optional. If there is no such a file in the corresponding
folder, there will be an empty entry in the data set. However, against
the backdrop of the European AI Act, we recommend to provide license and
bibliographic information to make the documentation of your models more
straightforward. Furthermore, some licenses, such as those provided by
Creative Commons, require statements about the creators, a copyright
notice, a URL or link to the source material (if possible), the license
of the material and a URL or link to the license’s text on the internet
or the license text itself. Please check the license requirements of the
material you are using, too.</p>
<p><strong>.pdf files</strong></p>
<p>The second alternative is to use .pdf files as a source for raw
texts. Here the necessary structure is similar to .txt files.</p>
<p>Please note that all files except the text file must be .txt, not
.pdf.</p>
<p>As stated above <code>bib_entry.txt</code>, <code>license.txt</code>,
<code>url_license.txt</code>, <code>text_license.txt</code>, and
<code>url_source.text</code> are optional.</p>
<p><strong>.xlsx files</strong></p>
<p>The third alternative is to store the raw texts as .xlsx files. This
alternative is practicable if you have many small raw texts. For raw
texts that are very large, such as books or papers, we recommend to
store them as .txt or .pdf files.</p>
<p>In order to add raw texts from .xlsx files, the files need a special
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a main folder for storing all .xlsx files you would like to
read.</li>
<li>All .xlsx files must contain the names of the columns in the first
row (Figure 7) and the names must be identical for each column across
all .xslx files you would like to read.</li>
<li>Every .xslx files must contain a column storing the text ID and must
contain a column storing the raw text. Every text must have a unique ID
across all .xlsx files.</li>
<li>Every .xslx file can contain an additional column for the bib
entry.</li>
<li>Every .xslx file can contain an additional column for the
license.</li>
<li>Every .xslx file can contain an additional column for the license’s
URL.</li>
<li>Every .xslx file can contain an additional column for the license’s
text.</li>
<li>Every .xslx file can contain an additional column for the source’s
URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your .xlsx file may look like</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_Create_Excel_file.png" style="width:75.0%" alt="Figure 7: Structure of Raw Texts within an Excel Sheet"><div class="figcaption">Figure 7: Structure of Raw Texts within an Excel
Sheet</div>
</div>
<p>The last step is to choose a folder where your collection of raw
texts should be saved. Please select a path and a folder name for your
LargeDataSet (<em>Create Data Set</em> button on the <em>Control
Panel</em>) (Figure 8). In the <em>Directory</em> field you specify the
location where to save the object and with <em>Folder Name</em> you
define the name of the folder that will be created within that
directory. In this folder the data set is saved.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_Create_Start_creation.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 8: Selecting a path for a data set"><div class="figcaption">Figure 8: Selecting a path for a data set</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, you can start creating the collection (<em>Continue</em>
button in Figure 8). Please note that this can take some time. You can
see the creation progress in the progress bars (Figure 9).</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_Create_Progress.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 9: Progress of Dataset creation process"><div class="figcaption">Figure 9: Progress of Dataset creation
process</div>
</div>
<p>When the process finishes you can see a message like in Figure 10 (if
the process has completed without any errors).</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_Create_Success.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 10: Progress of Dataset creation process"><div class="figcaption">Figure 10: Progress of Dataset creation
process</div>
</div>
<p>You now have a folder with the files that can be used for further
tasks like creation and training/tuning the transformers (<em>Base
Models</em> tab on the top panel), etc. The object contains a
<code>dataset</code> that stores the texts together with their IDs.</p>
<p>In case of .xlsx files, the texts’ IDs are set to the IDs stored in
the corresponding column for ID. In case of .pdf and .txt files, the
file names are used as ID (without the file extension).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that a consequence of this is that two files
<em>text_01.txt</em> and <em>text_01.pdf</em> have the same ID (see
Figure 11), which is not allowed. Please ensure that you use unique IDs
across file formats.</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="DM_Create_Text_sources.png" style="width:75.0%" alt="Figure 11: Filnames as IDs"><div class="figcaption">Figure 11: Filnames as IDs</div>
</div>
<p>The IDs are very important since they are used to match the
corresponding class/category, if available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="exploring-a-dataset">3.1.1.2 Exploring a Dataset<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exploring-a-dataset"></a>
</h5>
<p>To explore a large dataset for raw texts which is saved on the disk
you can use the <em>DataSetExplorer</em>. The <em>DataSetExplorer</em>
can be found on the tab <em>Data Management</em>.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_DataExplorer.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 12: DataExplorer"><div class="figcaption">Figure 12: DataExplorer</div>
</div>
<p>On the rights side (<em>Control Panel</em>) you can choose a folder
where the dataset is stored. After loading you can explore the texts by
using the widgets within the <em>Control Panel</em>. Please note that
the explorer is only used for displaying the raw texts and not for
changing the data.</p>
<p>The widget <em>Documents</em> allows you to select a document. With
help of the widget <em>Pages</em> you can browse between the different
pages of a document.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="collections-of-texts-labels">3.1.2 Collections of Texts’ Labels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collections-of-texts-labels"></a>
</h4>
<p>Labels are necessary if you would like to train a classifier. The
easiest way is to create a table that contains a column for the texts’
ID and one or multiple columns that contain the texts’
categories/classes. Supported file formats are .xlsx, .csv, and
.rda/.rdata. Figure 13 illustrates an example for a .xslx file.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="CF_Create_Targets.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="Figure 13: Target Data in Excel Files"><div class="figcaption">Figure 13: Target Data in Excel Files</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case, the table must contain a column with the name “id” which
contains the texts’ IDs. All other columns must also have unique names.
Please pay attention to use “id” and not “ID” or “Id”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you would like to create a dataset for labels without using Excel
you can use the <em>TableEditor</em>. The <em>TableEditor</em> is
located in the tab <em>Data Management</em>.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="DM_TableEditor.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 14: TableEditor"><div class="figcaption">Figure 14: TableEditor</div>

<p>On the right side you can either create a new empty table or load and

<p>Base models are the foundation of all further models in
<em>aifeducation</em>. At the moment, these are transformer models such
as BERT (Devlin et al. 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019), modernBERT
(Warner et al. 2024), Funnel-Transformer (Dai et al. 2020), Longformer
(Beltagy, Peters &amp; Cohan 2020), and MPNet (Song et al. 2020). As a
general first step, these models are trained on a large corpus of
general texts. In the next step, the models are fine-tuned to
domain-specific texts and/or fine-tuned for specific tasks. Since the
creation of base models requires a huge number of texts resulting in
high computational time, it is recommended to use pre-trained models.
These can be found on <a href="https://huggingface.co/" class="external-link">Huggingface</a>.
Sometimes, however, it is more straightforward to create a new model to
fit a specific purpose. Aifeducation Studio supports the opportunity to
both create and train/fine-tune base models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="creation-of-base-models">3.2.2 Creation of Base Models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creation-of-base-models"></a>
</h4>
<p>In order to create a new base model you have to choose the option
(tab) <em>Create</em> on the tab <em>Base Models</em> on the top panel
of the app. Figure 15 shows the corresponding page.</p>
<p><a href="BM_Create_Fill_fields.png"><img src="BM_Create_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 15: Base Models - Create Transformer"></a> Figure 15: Base
Models - Create Transformer (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>Every transformer model is composed of two parts: 1) the tokenizer
which splits raw texts into smaller pieces to model a large number of
words with a limited, small number of tokens and 2) the neural network
that is used to model the capabilities for understanding natural
language.</p>
<p>At the beginning you can choose between the different supported
transformer architectures (<em>Base Model Type</em> combobox in
<em>Control Panel</em>).</p>
<p>Depending on the architecture, you have different options determining
the shape of your neural network.</p>
<p>You find a box named <em>Input Data</em> at the top. Here you must
provide the path to a folder which contains a LargeDataSetForTexts. This
data set is used to calculate the vocabulary of the transformer. This
file should be created with <em>Aifeducation Studio</em> (tab <em>Data
Management</em>) to ensure compatibility. See section 3.1.1 for more
details.</p>
<p>In addition you find a box <em>Vocabulary</em>. Here you can
configure the vocabulary that the transformer should use. It is very
important that you provide a number of how many tokens the vocabulary
should include. Depending on the transformer method, you can set
additional options, affecting a transformer’s vocabulary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transform to Lower:</strong> If this option is enabled,
all words in a raw text are transformed to lower cases. For instance,
the resulting token of <em>Learners</em> and <em>learners</em> are the
same. If disabled, <em>Learners</em> and <em>learners</em> will have a
different tokenization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add Prefix Spaces:</strong> If enabled, a space is added
to the first word if there is not already one. Thus, enabling this
option leads to a similar tokenization for the word <em>learners</em> in
both cases: 1) “<em>learners</em> need a high motivation for high
achievement.” and 2) “A high motivation is necessary for
<em>learners</em> to achieve high performance.”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trim Offsets:</strong> If this option is enabled, the
white spaces of the produced offsets are trimmed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you can start the creation of your model by clicking on the
button “Create Model”. Here you have to select a directory and folder to
save the resulting model. The creation of the model may take some time.
You can see the progress of creation with progress bars.</p>

<h4 id="traintune-a-base-model">3.2.3 Train/Tune a Base Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#traintune-a-base-model"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you would like to train a new base model (see section 3.2.2) for
the first time or want to adapt a pre-trained model to a domain-specific
language or task, you have to click on the <em>Train</em> section on the
<em>Base Models</em> tab.</p>
<p><a href="BM_Train_Fill_fields.png"><img src="BM_Train_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 16: Base Models - Train/Tune Transformer"></a> Figure 16:
Base Models - Train/Tune Transformer (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>In the first step, you have to choose the base model you would like
to train/tune (box <em>Base Model</em>). Please note that every base
model consists of several files. Thus, you cannot provide neither single
nor multiple files. Instead you have to provide the folder that stores
the entire model.</p>
<p>Compatible models are all base models that you have created with
<em>Aifeducation Studio</em>. In addition you can use any model from <a href="https://huggingface.co/" class="external-link">Huggingface</a> that uses an architecture
implemented in <em>aifeducation</em> such as BERT, modernBERT, etc.</p>
<p>Second, you have to provide a LargeDataSetForTexts representing the
raw texts which should be used for training/tuning (box <em>Input
Data</em>). We recommend that you create this collection of texts as
described in section 3.1.1.</p>
<p>After choosing a base model, new boxes appear as shown in Figure
17.<br>
Possible options depend on the kind of model.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Size of Every Chunk:</strong> For training and validating
a base model, the raw texts are split into several smaller texts. This
value determines the maximum length of these smaller text pieces in
number of tokens. This value cannot exceed the maximum size set during
creation of the base model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal Sequence Length:</strong> This value determines
the minimal length of a text chunk in order to be part of the training
and validation data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full Sequences Only</strong>: If this option is enabled,
only text chunks with a number of tokens equal to “chunk size” are
included in the data. Disable this option if you have a lot of small
text chunks you would like to use for training and validation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability of Token Masking:</strong> This option
determines how many tokens of every sequence should be masked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability of Token Permutation:</strong> This option
determines how many tokens of every sequence are used for
permutation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Whole Word Masking:</strong> If this option is activated,
all tokens belonging to a single word are masked. If this options is
disabled or not available token masking is used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size of Validation Data Set:</strong> This option
determines how many sequences should be used for validating the
performance of the base model. Sequences used for validation are not
available for training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Batch Size:</strong> This option determines how many
sequences should be processed at the same time. Please adjust this value
to the computation capacities of your machine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Epochs:</strong> The maximum number of epochs for
training. During training, the model that has the best validation loss
is saved on disk an will be used for the final model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning Rate:</strong> The initial learning
rate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can start training the model by clicking on the button <em>Start
Training</em>. In this step, you have to provide the directory where
your trained model should be saved after training. It is very important
that this directory is not the same directory as the one you stored the
original model in.</p>
<p>Please note that the training of a base model can last days or even
weeks, depending on the size and the kind of model, the amount of data,
and the capacities of your machine. You can see the training progress
with the progress bars and plot (Figure 17).</p>

<p>The text embedding model is the interface to <em>R</em> in
<em>aifeducation</em>. In order to create a new model, you need a base
model that provides the ability to understand natural language. This
object contains all relevant information for transforming raw texts into
a numeric representation that can be used for machine learning.</p>
<p>In <em>aifedcuation</em>, the transformation of raw texts into
numbers is a separate step from downstream tasks such as classification.
This is to reduce computational time on machines with low performance.
By separating text embedding from other tasks, the text embedding has to
be calculated only once and can be used for different tasks at the same
time. Another advantage is that the training of the downstream tasks
involves only the downstream tasks and not the parameters of the
embedding model, making training less time-consuming, thus decreasing
computational intensity. Finally, this approach allows the analysis of
long documents by applying the same algorithm to different parts.</p>
<p>You can open the creation page by clicking on the “Create” tab in the
section “Text Embedding Models”. Figure 18 shows the corresponding
page.</p>
<p><a href="TEM_Create_Fill_fields.png"><img src="TEM_Create_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 18: Text Embedding Model - Create"></a> Figure 18: Text
Embedding Model - Create (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>First you have to choose the base model that should form the
foundation of your new text embedding model. Please select the folder
that contains the entire model and not single files (button <em>Choose a
Base Model</em> on the <em>Control Panel</em>).</p>
<p>After choosing a model, new boxes appear which allow you to customize
your interface. Here it is very important that you give your model a
unique name and label (<em>Control Panel</em>). The difference between
<em>Name</em> and <em>Label</em> is that <em>Name</em> is used for the
computer and <em>Label</em> for users. Thus, <em>Name</em> should not
contain any spaces or special characters. <em>Label</em> does not have
any restrictions. Think of <em>Label</em> as the title of a book or
paper. With <em>Label</em> you can also provide a version number if you
create a newer version of your model. In case you create a new model, we
recommend to use “0.0.1”. It is also important that you choose which
language your model is created for, such as English, French, German,
etc.</p>
<p>On the right side of the box <em>Interface Setting</em> you can set
how the interface should process raw text:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>N chunks:</strong> Sometimes texts are very long. With
this value, you can decide into how many chunks longer texts should be
divided. The maximum length of every chunk is determined by the value
provided at “Maximum Sequence Length”. Minimum if chunks is
two.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximal Sequence Length:</strong> This value determines
the maximum number of tokens your model processes for every
chunk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>N Token Overlap:</strong> This value determines how many
tokens form the prior chunk should be included in the current chunk. An
overlap can be useful to provide the correct context for every
chunk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Layers for Embeddings - Min</strong>: Base models
transform raw data into a sequence of numbers by using the different
layers’ hidden states. With this option you can decide which layer to
use first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Layers for Embeddings - Max</strong>: With this option
you can decide which is the last layer to use. The hidden states of all
layers between min and max are averaged to form the embedding of a text
chunk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pooling Type</strong>: With this option you can decide if
only the hidden states of the cls-token should be used for the
embedding. If you set this option to “Average”, the hidden states of all
tokens are averaged within each layer except the hidden states for
padding tokens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of tokens your model can process and provide for
downstream tasks can be calculated as
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>N</mi><mi>C</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>*</mo><mi>M</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>q</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>L</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mo>−</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>N</mi><mi>C</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mo>*</mo><mi>N</mi><mi>O</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Max Tokens = NChunks*MaximalSequenceLength-(NChunks-1)*NOverlap</annotation></semantics></math>
If the text is longer, the remaining tokens are ignored and lost for
further analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that you can create multiple text embedding models with a
different configuration based on the same base model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last step is to provide and name a folder to save the model to
(button <em>Save Model</em>).</p>

<h4 id="using-a-text-embedding-model">3.3.2 Using a Text Embedding Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-a-text-embedding-model"></a>
</h4>
<p>Using a text embedding model is a central aspect of applying
artificial intelligence in <em>aifeducation</em>. The corresponding page
can be found by clicking on “Use” in the tab “Text Embedding Models”. At
the start you have to choose the model that you would like to use.
Please select the folder that contains the entire model instead of
selecting single files (button <em>Choose a Model</em>). After selecting
and loading a model, a new box appears that shows you the different
aspects of the model and how you can use it.</p>
<p>The tab <em>Description</em> (Figure 19) provides you with the
documentation of the model.</p>
<p><a href="TEM_Use_Fill_fields.png"><img src="TEM_Use_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 19: Text Embedding Model - Description"></a> Figure 19:
Text Embedding Model - Description (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>The tab <em>Training</em> shows the development of the loss and the
validation loss during the last training of the corresponding base
model. If no plot is displayed, no history data is available.</p>
<p>The tab <em>Embed Text</em> (Figure 20) allows you to transform raw
texts into a numerical representation of these texts, called text
embeddings. These text embeddings can be used in downstream tasks such
as classifying texts. In order to transform raw texts into embedded
texts, you first have to select a collection of raw texts (a folder
containing several files). We recommend that you create this collection
according to section 3.1.1. Next you have to provide the folder where
the embeddings should be stored and name it. With <em>Batch Size</em>
you can determine how many raw texts should be processed simultaneously.
Please adjust this value to your machine’s capacities. By clicking on
the button “Save Embeddings” the transformation of texts begins.</p>
<p><a href="TEM_Use_Embedd_text.png"><img src="TEM_Use_Embedd_text.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 20: Text Embedding Model - Embeddings"></a> Figure 20:
Text Embedding Model - Embeddings (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>The tab <em>Tokenize/Encode/Decode</em> (Figure 21) offers you
insights into the way your text embedding model processes data. In the
box <em>Encode</em> you can insert a raw text and after clicking on
<em>Encode,</em> you can see how the text is divided into tokens and
their corresponding IDs. The IDs are passed to the base model and are
used to generate the numeric representation of a text. The box
<em>Decode</em> allows you to reverse this process. There you can insert
a sequence of numbers (separated with a comma or with spaces) and after
clicking on <em>Decode</em>, the corresponding tokens and the raw text
appear.</p>

enlarge)</p>
<p>Finally, the tab <em>Fill Mask</em> (Figure 22) allows you to request
the underlying base model of your text embedding model to calculate a
solution to a fill-in-the-blank text. In the box <em>Text</em> you can
insert a raw text. A gap is signaled when you insert the corresponding
masking token. This token can be found in the table above in the row for
“mask_token”. If you insert a gap/mask_token please ensure correct
spelling. With <em>N Solutions per mask</em> you can determine how many
tokens the model should calculate for every gap/mask_token. After
clicking “Calculate Tokens”, you will find an image on the right side of
the box, showing you the most reasonable token for the selected gap. The
tokens are ordered by certainty; from the perspective of the model, the
most reasonable tokens are at the top and the less reasonable tokens are
at the bottom.</p>

<p>Creating “good” AI models requires a lot of effort. Thus, sharing
work with other users is very important to support progress in a
discipline. Thus, meaningful documentation is required. In addition, a
well written documentation makes an AI model more transparent, allowing
others to understand how the AI model generated a solution. This is also
very important in order to judge the limitations of a model.</p>
<p>To support developers in documenting their work, <em>Aifeducation
Studio</em> provides an easy way to add a comprehensive description. You
find this part of the app by clicking on “Document” in the tab <em>Text
Embedding Models</em>. First, you have to choose the text embedding
model you would like to document (not the base model!).</p>
<p>After choosing a model, a new box appears, allowing you to insert the
necessary information. Via the tabs <em>Developers</em> and
<em>Modifiers</em>, you can provide the names and email addresses of all
relevant contributors. <em>Developers</em> refer to the people who

<p>Classifiers are built on top of a text embedding model. To create a
classifier, click on <em>Create</em> in the tab <em>Classifiers</em>.
Figure 24 shows the corresponding page.</p>

Classifier - Creation Part 1 (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>First, you choose a core model within the <em>Control Panel</em> on
the left side. It determines where different layers are located and how
the outputs of the different layers are combined into the final output
of the model.</p>
<p>The sequential architecture (see Figure 25) provides models where the
input is passed to a specific number of layers step by step. All layers
are grouped by the kind of layer into stacks.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="core_arch_sequential.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 25: Basic Architecture of a Sequential Classifier"><div class="figcaption">Figure 25: Basic Architecture of a Sequential
Classifier</div>
</div>
<p>In contrast, the parallel architecture (see 26) offers a model where
an input is passed to different types of layers separately. At the end
the outputs are combined to create the final output of the whole
model.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="core_arch_parallel.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 26: Basic Architecture of a Parallel Classifier"><div class="figcaption">Figure 26: Basic Architecture of a Parallel

</div>
<p>You can find the name of the used core model in the name of the
classifier. For example <code>TEClassifierSequential</code> uses a
<em>sequential</em> core model while <code>TEClassifierParallel</code>
uses a <em>parallel</em> core model.</p>
<p>In general, all layers within a core model allow further
customization allowing you to build a high number of different models
(see box <em>Model Configuration</em> in Figure 25).</p>
<p>Second, you can choose how the core model is used for classification.
At the moment a probability and metric based classifier is possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Probability Classifiers:</strong> Probability classifiers
are used to predict a probability distribution for different
classes/categories. This is the standard case most common in
literature.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prototype Based Classifiers:</strong> Prototype based
classifiers are a kind of metric based classifiers. Here the classifiers
do not predict a probability distribution. Instead it calculates a
prototype for every class/category and measures the distance between a
case and all prototypes. The class/category of the prototype with the
smallest distance to the case is assigned to that case. In contrast to
the probability classifiers these models can handle classes/categories
that were not part of the training.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that creating, training, and predicting works for all
types of classifiers as described in the sections below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a classifier requires two kinds of data. First, a text
embedding of a collection of texts. These embeddings should be created
with a text embedding model as described in section 3.3.2. Second, a
table with the labels of every text. This kind of data should be created
as described in section 3.1.2.</p>
<p>You can provide the text embeddings by opening the corresponding file
in the first box (<em>Input Data</em>) by clicking on the <em>Choose
Embeddings</em> button. After selecting the embeddings, you will see a
summary of the underlying text embedding model that generated the
embeddings. In addition, you can see how many documents are in the
file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that the classifier is bound to the text embedding model
that generated the embeddings. That is, the classifier can only be used
if you have access to the corresponding text embedding model. The text
embedding model is necessary to transform raw texts into a format that
the classifier can understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the second box (<em>Target Data</em>), you can select the file
that contains the corresponding labels. After loading the file, you can
select the column of the table that you would like to use as target data
for training. In addition, you can see a short summary of the absolute
frequencies of the single classes/categories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that you can create multiple classifiers for different
target data based on the same text embedding model. Thus, there is no
need to create a new text embedding model for a new classifier. In
particular, you can use the same text embeddings for training different
classifiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very important that you provide the model’s label in the
<em>Control Panel</em>. <em>Model Label</em> is used as a title of your
classifiers for other users.</p>
<p>In the third box (<em>Model Configuration</em>) you customize the
architecture of your neural network (Figure 27).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you hover over a widget or a question mark you get additional
information!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next box (<em>Training SetUp</em>) contains the setting for
training your classifier (Figure 28). Going into detail is again beyond
the scope of this introduction. Here we can only provide an
overview.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Balance Class Weights</strong>: If this option is
enabled, the loss is adjusted to the absolute frequencies of the
classes/categories according to the ‘Inverse Class Frequency’ method.
This option should be activated if you have to deal with imbalanced
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balance Sequence Length</strong>: Activating this option
can increase performance if you have to deal with texts that differ in
their lengths and have an imbalanced frequency. If this option is
enabled, the loss is adjusted to the absolute frequencies of length of
your texts according to the ‘Inverse Class Frequency’ method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of Folds:</strong> The number of folds used for
estimating the performance of your classifier.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportion for Validation Sample:</strong> The percentage
of cases within each fold used as a validation sample. This sample is
used to determine the state of the model that generalizes best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Epochs:</strong> Maximal number of epochs. During
training, the model with the best balanced accuracy is saved and
used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Batch Size:</strong> The number of cases that should be
processed simultaneously. Please adjust this value to your machine’s
capacities. Please note that the batch size can have an impact on the
classifier’s performance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section: Synthetic Cases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Add Synthetic Cases:</strong> If active, the creation of
additional synthetic cases is applied during training. They are added to
the train data. The way these cases are generated can be configured with
the following parameters:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Method:</strong> The method which should be used for
generating the cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Min k:</strong> The minimal number of neighbors used for
generating the synthetic cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max k:</strong> The maximum number of neighbors used for
generating the synthetic cases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm will generate a number of synthetic cases for every
class to ensure that the number of cases for every class equals the
number of cases of the majority class. The synthetic cases for every
class a generated for all <em>k</em> between <em>Min k</em> and <em>Max
k</em>. Every <em>k</em> contributes proportional to the synthetic
cases.</p>
<p><strong>Section: Pseudo-Labeling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Pseudo Labeling:</strong> If activated,
pseudo-labeling is used during training as described by Cascante-Bonilla
et al. (2020). The way pseudo-labeling is applied can be configured with
the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Max Steps:</strong> The number of steps during
pseudo-labeling. For example, in the first step, 1/Max Steps
pseudo-labeled cases are added, in the second step, 2/Max Steps
pseudo-labeled cases are added, etc.. Which cases are added can be
influenced by <em>Balance Pseudo-Labels</em>, <em>Certainty Anchor</em>,
<em>Max Certainty Value</em>, and <em>Min Certainty Value</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Certainty Anchor:</strong> This value determines the
reference point for choosing pseudo-labeled cases. 1 refers to perfect
certainty, 0 refers to a certainty similar to random guessing. Selected
are the cases that are closest to this value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max Certainty Value:</strong> Pseudo-labeled cases
exceeding this value are not included during training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Min Certainty Value:</strong> Pseudo-labeled cases
falling bellow this value are not included during training.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend to use pseudo-labeling as described by Cascante-Bonilla
et al. (2020). Therefore, the following parameters have to be set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Max Steps = 5</li>
<li>Max Certainty Value = 1.00</li>
<li>Certainty Anchor = 1.00</li>
<li>Min Certainty Value = 0.00</li>
</ul>

Classifier - Creation Part 3 (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>Before you start training, you can check how many cases can be
matched between the text embeddings and the target data by clicking on
the button <em>Test Data Matching</em> (<em>Control Panel</em> in Figure
29). This allows you to check if the structure of the data is working.
If everything is okay you can provide the directory where you would like
to save the model and start training the model by clicking on <em>Train
Model</em>.</p>
<p>Please note that training a classifier can take up to several hours.
You can see your progress in the progress bars.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="using-a-classifier">3.4.2 Using a Classifier<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-a-classifier"></a>
</h4>
<p>In case you have trained a classifier or are using a classifier
trained by other users, you can analyze the model’s performance or use
the model to classify new texts. To do so, you have to select the
<em>Use</em> tab in the tab <em>Classifiers</em>.</p>
<p>Similar to the other functions of this app, you first have to select
the classifier by providing the folder that contains the entire model.
Please note that a classifier is made up of several files. Thus,
<em>Aifeducation Studio</em> asks you to select the folder containing
these files and not single files. After loading a classifier, a new box
appears.</p>
<p>In the first tab, <em>Description</em> (Figure 29), you will find the
documentation of the model.</p>
<p><a href="CF_Use_Fill_fields.png"><img src="CF_Use_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 29: Classifier - Description"></a>
Figure 29: Classifier - Description (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>In the second tab, <em>Training</em> (Figure 30), you receive a
summary of the training process of the model. This includes a
visualization of the loss, the accuracy, and the balanced accuracy for
every fold and every epoch. Depending on the applied training techniques
(such as <em>Balanced Pseudo-Labeling</em>), you can request additional
images.</p>

Figure 30: Classifier - Training (click image to enlarge)</p>
<p>The third tab, <em>Reliability</em> (Figure 31), provides you with
the information on the model’s quality. Here you can find visualizations
giving you insights into how the classifier is able to generate reliable
results. In addition, measures from content analysis as well as machine
learning allow you to analyze specific aspects of the model’s
performance.</p>

<p>The last tab, <em>Prediction</em> (Figure 32), allows you to apply a
trained model to new data. Here you can use the trained model to assign
classes/categories to new texts. For this purpose, you must first
provide the file that contains the text embeddings of the documents you
would like to classify. You can create these embeddings with the text
embedding model used for providing the training data of the classifier.
The necessary steps are described in section 3.3.2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These embeddings must be created with the same text embedding model
that created the text embeddings for training. If not, an error will
occur. See section 3.4.1 and 3.3.2 for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next step is to provide the folder where you would like to save
the predictions and to provide a file name. The default case is to store
the predictions in an .csv file. The resulting data table may look like
shown in Figure 33.</p>

<h4 id="documenting-a-classifier">3.4.3 Documenting a Classifier<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documenting-a-classifier"></a>
</h4>
<p>Documenting a classifier is similar to the documentation of a text
embedding model (section 3.3.3).</p>
<p>To support developers in documenting their work, <em>Aifeducation
Studio</em> provides an easy way to add a comprehensive description. You
find this part of the app by clicking on <em>Document</em> tab in the
tab <em>Classifiers</em>. First, you have to choose the classifier you
would like to document.</p>
<p>After choosing a model, a new box appears, allowing you to insert the
necessary information. Via the tab <em>Developers</em>, you can provide
the names and email addressees of all relevant contributors.</p>
<p>In the tabs <em>Abstract</em> and <em>Description</em>, you can
provide an abstract and a detailed description of your work in English
and/or in the native language of your classifier (e.g., French, German,
etc.), allowing you to reach a broader audience. In all four tabs you
can provide your documentation in plain text, html, and/or markdown
allowing you to insert tables or to highlight parts of your
documentation. If you would like to see what your documentation will
look like on the internet, you can click on the button “Preview”. Saving
your changes is possible by clicking on <em>Save</em></p>

<h4 id="feature-extractors">3.5.1 Feature Extractors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feature-extractors"></a>
</h4>
<p>Another option to increase a model’s performance and/or to increase
computational speed is to apply a feature extractor. For example, the
work by Ganesan et al. (2021) indicates that a reduction of the hidden
size can increase a model’s accuracy. In <em>aifeducation,</em> a
feature extractor is a model that tries to reduce the number of features
of given text embeddings before feeding the embeddings as input to a
classifier.</p>
<p>The feature extractors implemented in <em>aifeducation</em> are
auto-encoders that support sequential data and sequences of different
length. The basic architecture of all extractors is shown in the
following figure.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="classif_feature_extractor.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 34: Basic architecture of feature extractors"><div class="figcaption">Figure 34: Basic architecture of feature
extractors</div>
</div>
<p>The learning objective of the feature extractors is first to compress
information by reducing the number of features to the number of features
of the latent space (Frochte 2019, p.281). In the figure above, this
would mean to reduce the number of features from 8 to 4 and to store as
much information as possible from the 8 dimensions in only 4 dimensions.
In the next step, the extractor tries to reconstruct the original
information from the compressed information of the latent space (Frochte
2019, pp.280-281). The information is extended from 4 dimensions to 8.
After training, the hidden representation of the latent space is used as
a compression of the original input.</p>
<p>You can create a feature extractor as follows in Figure 35
(<em>Create</em> tab in the tab <em>Feature Extractors</em>).</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="FE_Create_Fill_fields.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Figure 35: Feature Extractors - Create"><div class="figcaption">Figure 35: Feature Extractors - Create</div>
</div>
<p>First, you need to choose embeddings by using the box <em>Input
Data</em>.</p>
<p>You can specify the label of the model in the <em>Model Label</em>
field within the <em>Control Panel</em>.</p>
<p>Specify an architecture and training settings in <em>Model
Configuration</em> and <em>Training SetUp</em> boxes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Number of Features</em> determines the number of features for
the compressed representation. The lower the number, the higher the
requested compression. This value corresponds with the features of the
latent space in the figure above.</p></li>
<li><p>With <em>Method</em> you determine the type of layer the feature
extractor should use. If set “LSTM”, all layers of the model are long
short-term memory layers. If set “dense”, all layers are standard dense
layers.</p></li>
<li><p>With <em>Noise Factor</em> you can add some noise during
training, making the feature extractor do a denoising auto encoder,
which can provide more robust generalizations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you are ready to start training, just click on the <em>Train
Model</em> button. Then you have to choose a path to a folder and a
folder name where you want to store the model.</p>
<p>Please note that training a feature extractor can take up to several
hours. You can see your progress in the progress bars.</p>
<p>After you have trained your feature extractor, you can use it for
every classifier. Just pass the feature extractor path to <em>Feature
Extractor</em> during configuration of the classifier (Figure 24).</p>
<p>That is all. Now you can use and train the classifier in the same way
as without a feature extractor.</p>
<p>You can explore and document the model similar to all other models.
Figure 36 shows an example for exploring training.</p>
