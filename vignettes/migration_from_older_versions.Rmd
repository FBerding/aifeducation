# 1 Migration from 0.3.3 and lower to 1.0.0 and higher

Starting with version 1.0.0 we introduced a new structure for the models
together with a new mechanism for loading and saving objects. In the case you
would like to use models created with an older version of the package 
(version 0.3.3 and lower) you still can use the functions `save_ai_model` and `load_ai_model`
for loading and saving the models.The usage of the models remains unchanged.

The newer function `save_to_disk` and `load_from_disk` will
**not** work for the older models and apply only to the newer models.
